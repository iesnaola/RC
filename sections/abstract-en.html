<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
The Result-Context ODP consists of a class eep:Execution (defined in the EEP ODP) and five properties that represent its context in terms of the result (rc:hasResult and rc:hasSimpleResult), temporal context (rc:hasGenerationTime and cp:hasTemporalContext) and spatial context (rc:hasSpatialContext).

This ODP is an extension of the EEP ODP (https://w3id.org/eep). It defines the context of an execution in terms of the result, temporal context and spatial context. The result can be modeled both with the rc:hasResult object property (if it is modeled as an RDF IRI) or the rc:hasSimpleResult data property (if it is modeled as an RDF Literal). As for the temporal context, the instant or time interval when an execution happens or has its effect is modeled with the rc:hasTemporalContext object property and the instant when an execution is generated is modeled with the rc:hasGenerationTime datatype property. Finally, the location where an execution takes place is modeled with the rc:hasSpatialContext object property.</span>
